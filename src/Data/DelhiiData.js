      "You are invited to become a part of the unique mix of colours, smells, sounds, tastes and unforgettable images. Take the tour and experience the city of Delhi with all your senses. The Delhi By Cycle is one of the wonderful experience to explore the streets of Delhi. With five fascinating routes - three in Old Delhi and two in New Delhi, covering the most interesting, intense, historical and beautiful areas of Old and New Delhi. Each of the tours is beautiful and interesting in its own way, with a unique focus, taking you to the hidden wonders of the city. Delhi by Cycle (Shah Jahan Tour – Old Delhi) At the time of its construction in the 17th century, Shahjanabad or Old Delhi was arguably the most prosperous and beautiful city in the world. Cycle round its narrow alleys held together with great big meshes of electric cables and infused with the smell of brewing tea and simmering breakfast curry. It is a mind boggling mélange of the past and the present. Cycle past the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, visit the Spice Market and enjoy the tranquil Civil Lines, the former residential area of British Delhi which is a sharp contrast to the hectic Shahjanabad. Breakfast is at Karims, an Old Delhi institution. Be aware, Vegetarian choices are very limited at Karim’s. OR Delhi by Cycle (Raj Tour - New Delhi) This tour is a ride down through Delhi’s more recent history. Starting from the narrow lanes of Old Delhi, passing through quaint old quarters of government employees; guests almost magically land in Lutyen’s Delhi with its iconic Colonial Buildings such as the Presidential Palace and India Gate encircled by spotlessly clean, tree-lined roads. Breakfast is at Bengali Sweet House famous for its North Indian street food. OR New Delhi Cycling Tour Bicycle on the lanes of Connaught Place, cross the India Gate and the President House- Rashtrapati Bhawan. You will be surely amazed to see the expanse of the Bhawan and its grand surroundings. After the tour, enjoy a scrumptious breakfast with delicious regional delicacies from one of the many State Bhawans. OR Nizamuddin tour (New Delhi) It's a high spiritual area named Nizamuddin, named after the famous Sufi saint. An urban village right in the heart of Delhi. On this tour we visit another urban village, Kotla Mubarak. Together with the magnificent Humayun's Tomb and beautiful Lodhi Garden the Nizamuddin tour reflects the periods when Delhi was ruled by the Sultans, Mughals and British and finally independency after the Partition in 1947.The tour is 15 km long. We are proud to have partnered with the Nizamuddin settlement based NGO - Hope Project, for this tour. Hope supports the local community of Nizamuddin in health care and education. OR Yamuna tour (Old Delhi) The route is an ode to this river that has been a silent witness to Delhi’s history and is now a recurrent victim of its excesses. Starting from the little lanes of Shahjahanabad, while the city is still sleepy in its proverbial socks-passing along the magnificently formidable walls of the Red Fort we find ourselves on the meditative quiet banks of the Yamuna at Nigambodh Ghat. A boat-ride along its shores – migratory birds circling above the calm waters - unravels the ritualistic devotion with which the Hindus treat the historic river. Languages English Others Please note: During the summer season (April-September), the Yamuna tour does not include the boat ride due to the water condition. The Yamuna tour will still include a stop at the riverbank and a visit to the nearby cow shelter.",

      "Discover Lake Surajkund, located just 20 kilometers from the heart of Delhi. In reality, Surajkund is not a lake, but an artificial reservoir whose name in Hindi means sun dam. The reservoir was built by King Surajpal around the 10th century. Surajkund is the place where the Tomara dynasty settled before building the city of Lal Kot. The reservoir owes its name to an ancient temple of the sun, although some historians claim that it is named after the king. Surajkund's structure follows a semicircular pattern with steps leading down to the water. The reservoir remains active thanks to the monsoon water. Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq, a so-called lunatic who decided to fix all the monuments in Delhi, repaired its levees in the 14th century. Be captivated by the beauty of its surroundings and the tranquility that they inspire. Today Surajkund is the quintessential picnic spot chosen by locals and tourists alike. Every year in February the reservoir hosts an important craft fair. Although it is very common to visit it during the day, if you want to get away from the bustle of the city, we recommend spending the night in any of the nearby hostels, a perfect opportunity to contemplate its beauty and learn a little more about the local lifestyle.",

    location: "Delhi and NCR",
    description:
      "Delhi can be an overwhelming experience for even the most seasoned traveller. That’s why our expert local guides have teamed up with The New York Times travel team to curate the ultimate Delhi tour. Experience colonial India with an English High Tea with a distinctly Indian twist, discover the poetic significance of kite flying in Indian culture and visit one of the country’s most famous and intoxicating spice markets. Not only will you see the city’s top sights, like the Jama Masjid and Haveli Dharampura but we will take you off the beaten path to discover what makes the city and its people tick. If you want to get under the skin of everyday life in Delhi, this is the tour for you. The best way to traverse this vast metropolis is to ride on the Delhi Metro, the world’s 10th-longest's system where the air-conditioning offers welcome relief from the overpowering heat above ground. We’ll get off at the bustling Chawri Bazar station to take a peak at India’s biggest mosque, Jama Masjid. This architectural gem was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 (he also built the Red Fort and the Taj Mahal). The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 people and there are 899 black marble tiles on the floor that act as prayer mats for worshipers. Here you will see important Islamic relics, including sandals and a strand of hair that once belonged to the Prophet Muhammad. Then we will take the steps to the top of the minaret for a bird’s-eye view of Old Delhi and try to imagine the generations of history this tower has watched over. Haveli Dharampura is a traditional townhouse, built in 1887 in the style of the late Mughal period which favored vibrant decoration and open courtyards. It is now an elegant hotel and restaurant. The restoration of this beautiful building was only completed in 2016, after a local politician, Vijay Goel, campaigned for it to be brought back to life. We will take a tour of the property with one of the staff and learn about its history and its remarkable transformation. Kite flying is a symbol of elevated vision and high aspirations. It is a time-honored tradition in India which culminates each year with the colorful Delhi Kite Festival. Competition is so fierce that contestants often use glass-coated or metal strings in an attempt to cut their rivals’ strings. We won’t go that far but we will have a go at flying our own kite high into the Delhi sky. A relaxing high tea is next on our cultural agenda. An enchanting remnant of the British tradition, most Indian high teas include chai and samosas instead of Earl Grey and watercress sandwiches, which adds a welcome degree of spice to proceedings. A rickshaw ride should be mandatory during a trip to Delhi; there’s no better way of seeing the city at its chaotic best. We’ll hop on and make our way to Khari Baoli, a street near the Red Fort that houses Asia’s largest wholesale spice market, in operation since the 17th century. A large number of the shops here are run by the ancestors of the original market founders, going back nine or ten generations. We will visit Mehar Chand and Sons, which has been selling spices at this location for more than a century, and meet the merchants. Learn about the different masala spice blends, chilies and teas from all over India from a master blender and see how the spices are stored. The spice market fills your senses, so calm your palate with some ice cream. This isn’t the ice cream that you’re used to though. Known as kulfi, this sweet treat is creamier and denser than what you might be used to and is infused with delicate flavors such as almond, pistachio, rosewater, strawberry, peanut and mango. After this refreshing pick-me-up, we will take the Metro from Chandni Chowk station and walk back to the starting point of our tour.",

Once you reach Agra, than your tour begins to explore the architectural beauty of Agra - the Taj Mahal - one of the Seven Wonders of the World, visit the Red Fort - which reveals the power of the Mughal Empire and discover the Itmad-Ud-Daulah Mausoleum. This fascinating full day Agra city tour offers the ultimate insight into one of India’s most delightful and romantic cities. Your first stop is the “Taj Mahal,” built by Shah Jahan in 1560 in loving memory of his queen, Mumtaz Mahal, to enshrine her mortal remains. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the ivory-white marble mausoleum sits on the south bank of the Yamuna river. Then visit Agra Fort – a UNESCO World Heritage site built by Emperor Akbar. The construction of this massive structure began in 1565 under Akbar, and continued till the time of his grandson, Shahjahan. Armed with massive double walls punctuated by four gateways, the fort houses a procession of palaces, courts, mosques, baths, gardens and gracious pavilions. Among the fascinating structures that are to be found within the fort is the red sandstone Jehangiri Mahal built by Akbar for his Hindu queen Jodhabai, one of the earliest constructions illustrating the fort's change of purpose from a military structure into a royal palace. Also, take the time to discover the Itmad-Ud-Daulah Mausoleum with Indo-Muslim architecture also known as the 'Baby Taj'. Do not forget to explore the Mehtab Bagh Gardens facing the Taj Mahal on the opposite bank of the Yamuna River. They are perfectly aligned with the immaculate mausoleum and thus offer a privileged view, especially in the last hours of the day.
